Silver moonlight hums,
whispers hush the night.
Golden rain glows,
memories drift slow.
Footsteps dance soft,
lost in time’s breath.
Restless waves kiss,
fading moments spill.
Autumn holds secrets,
a lullaby long forgotten,
glowing stars fade,
shore whispers hush,
love fleeting,
like autumn’s glow.
