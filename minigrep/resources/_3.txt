Hush, whispers fade,
moonlight glows soft.
Footsteps drift slow,
memories spill silver.
Golden leaves kiss waves,
secrets lost in rain.
Autumn hums, time hushes,
lullabies forgotten.
Shore glows restless,
breath fleeting,
distant stars dance,
held in loveâ€™s glow,
a moment fading,
like golden rain.
